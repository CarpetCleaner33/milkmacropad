## Project Description

Micro pad inspired by the Milk 2% Keyboard. In this project, I designed the housing and attempted to replicate the key pad without the use of custom PCB's.

## Design Process

The Arduino/switch housing was designed using Autodesk's Fusion 360 CAD software. This first iteration of the model was done in late 2022 but current version was finished as of writing this ( June 2023). I was swamnped with exams
and the project had to be put on a stop. Measurements for the mechanical switch cut out was obtained from the Redox Handwire mechanical keyboard by Mattia Dal Ben. On my first attempt, my cutouts were 1.6ish mm short and the switches were not able to fit in.
Anything I used will be linked in the 'Aknowledgements' section.
