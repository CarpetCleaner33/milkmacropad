## Project Description

Micro pad inspired by the Milk 2% Keyboard. In this project, I designed the housing and attempted to replicate the keypad without the use of custom PCBs.

## Design Process

The Arduino/switch housing was designed using Autodesk's Fusion 360 CAD software. This first iteration of the model was done in late 2022 but the current version was finished as of writing this ( June 2023).
and the project had to be put to a stop. Measurements for the mechanical switch cut-out were obtained from the Redox Handwire mechanical keyboard by Mattia Dal Ben. On my first attempt, my cutouts were 1.6ish mm short and the switches were not able to fit in. This macro pad uses Gateron yellow mechanical switches.
Anything I used will be linked in the 'Acknowledgments' section.


## Installation

- In Progress

## Usage

This macro pad will be bound to the f13 and f14 keys. These will probably be programmed using an open-source keyboard firmware builder such as [kbfirmware](https://kbfirmware.com/).

## Timeline

- First iteration of milk carton designed (December 2022)
- First assembled prototype printed (June 2023)
- Github created (June 2023)
- Project completed (June 2023)

- First iteration vs latest iteration (June 2023)
  - 15% larger to account for wires and Arduino pro micro
  - 20% infill, cubic
  - Standard print quality (0.20 mm)
